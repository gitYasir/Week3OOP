# Playing Banjo!

### What does the program do?

    The program takes in a name and returns a string saying if the person is playing the banjo or not. This depends on the persons' name. It returns the person is playing the banjo If their name starts with "R" or "r" only. Otherwise the person is not playing the banjo.

### What was the development approach?

    I am using test driven development. My aim is to right failing tests, making them pass then refactoring the code.
